Part 2 of the "Data And IPFS" track will focus on content-addressed data transfer protocols, focusing on four key areas:

1. Multi-party data transfer
2. Efficient graph synchronization
3. connection integrity
4. connection saturation

description="CAR Mirror, CAR Pool, and Private-XOR are attempts to radically reduce the number of round trips, minimize (but not eliminate) redundant blocks, and push and pull data over mature channels, in unicast, multicast, and anycast scenarios. This is well suited to undialable nodes such as browsers, directly connected swarms (e.g. after DHT lookup), and broadcasting blind indices."
