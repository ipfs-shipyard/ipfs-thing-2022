_You can’t improve what you don’t measure and you should measure what (you think) you’ve just improved._

We need to get to a point where we can measure the performance of all protocol and system components of the IPFS stack, identify bottlenecks and propose optimizations.

In this track we will present the measurement studies we've kickstarted and will then go on to explore the components that will benefit from more detailed monitoring. We'll also workshop on the details of the methodologies needed in order to actually have this monitoring in place. Ultimately, the session's target is to identify how we can transition towards a culture of protocol measurement, monitoring & optimization.

Anyone is welcome to pop in and bring new items to our attention.

title="DHT Routing Table entries: are they up-to-date?"
description="Every DHT Server peer keeps a list of entries in its routing table in order to be able to communicate and redirect other peers to the peer that is most likely to have the required information. These entries need to be updated in order to keep up with network churn and other events. In this talk we'll describe the methodology we used to identify whether the DHT Routing Table is keeping healthy as well as results about the accuracy of entries."

title="Provider Records: do they stay alive long enough?"
description="Provider records help content stay alive in the IPFS network. But they come with several settings that have to be tuned to the right value in order to take into account network churn, but also avoid overloading the network or the end peers. In this talk we'll show what we did to monitor the effectiveness of these settings as well as whether they're effective or need fine-tuning."
