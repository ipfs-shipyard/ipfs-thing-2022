description = """

This track aims to create space for advancing the IPFS project and community. New session proposals are welcome, especially those that focus on a specific, actionable subtopic rather than attempting to grapple with project and community stewardship.

Currently, we have reserved a 1/2 day for this track. If enough sessions are proposed, this track will be extended into Friday afternoon.

It'll provide practical information on how to request changes to the configuration (for example, if you contribute frequently to a repository within IPFS and you'd want to become a collaborator) and how to set up a similar solution in any other GitHub organization."

description="IPFS's public presence predominantly communicates that there are 2 IPFS implementations, js-ipfs and go-ipfs. It also communicates that the project is essentially PL-owned. During this session, we will re-orient some key landing pages toward today's Cambrian explosion of new implementations. This is intended to a fairly short and surgical discussion to kick off, with plans to follow through during afternoon hack time."
