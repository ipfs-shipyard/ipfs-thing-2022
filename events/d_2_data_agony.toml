This track will cover pain points stemming from the way data is structured within IPFS & IPLD

- MerkleDAG views, multi-block data abstractions, ingesting Filestore at rest
- Making UnixFS not special (e.g. rendering other types of files/folders on gateways)
- The relationships between Checksums, Blocks, etc.
- Compatibility with existing (and new) hash linked data structures
