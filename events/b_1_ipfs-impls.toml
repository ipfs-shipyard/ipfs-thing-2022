description = """
This track provides an overview of IPFS implementations. Each presentation is about a different IPFS Implementation, and meant to be a pitch for the implementation to prospective users, contributors, etc. Think of these presentations as listed in a webpage about IPFS implementations.

Each talk should cover:
- What the implementation is for (problems / solutions)
- How it works / architecture
- Team (who's building it)
- Traction so far
- Roadmap
- Painpoints: what the impl is not good at.
