## LabWeek 2022 Location and Dates

LabWeek 2022 is happening October 20th to November 4th, in Lisbon.

## Decentralized Event

A decentralized event is a series of related events happening around
the same place and time, put on by a community. The goal is to enable people
and groups to host their own events, loosely coordinating with the rest of the
community.

Anyone can submit new tracks or sessions!

## Submitting tracks or sessions

### Add a session to an existing track
Sessions can be run in many formats: roundtables, talks with slides, hack sessions, whiteboard sessions, or more. 

1. Go to `/events` and find the .toml file for that track.
2. Edit the file to include details of your proposed session.
3. Create a PR to this repo, and respond to feedback.
4. Respond to feedback from the track leader, who will decide whether to merge & publish your session.

### Add a new track
Tracks are a group of sessions with a common theme.

1. Make a copy of `events/_template-event.toml` or `events/_template-track.toml` into `events/your-event.toml`
2. Edit the file to include all the details about your event.
3. File a pull-request in this repo, and respond to feedback.
4. The organizers will decide whether to merge & publish your event.

### What venue do I put?

Leave it blank for now, we'll try to assign rooms closer to the event.

### CSV dump of talks

To get a dump of talks/speakers for custom analysis, you can:
1. Install the python version of yq: https://github.com/kislyuk/yq
  - ``brew install python-yq``
2. Run a command like ``tomlq -r '.name as $track_name | .date as $track_date | .timeslots[] | [$track_name, $track_date, .startTime, .title, (.speakers | join(" "))] | @csv' *.toml``
